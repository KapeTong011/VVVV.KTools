# VVVV.KTools
这是我在学习和使用VVVV 的过程中用到的一些比较有用的Subpatch 编写方法。目前还不是很多，会随着深入学习不断更新。 
I build this repo to store some of the patches I think useful during my learning and exercising. You can download them and do whatever you like with them.
# How to use them as subpatches?
要在你自己的项目中使用我提供的这些文件作为subpatch，很简单，只需下载对应的xml文件到本地，然后将文件扩展名由.XML 修改为.V4P 即可。现在你就可以通过拖拽的方式将它加入你的项目中了。通过右键点击拖拽至项目中的subpatch，可以浏览我对它的简单说明。 
To use my patches as subpatches, simply clone the one suits your need to your computer, then change the filename from XXX.XML to XXX.V4P. Voila! Now you've got a functional subpatch ready at your service. Drag and drop it to your main patch and let it do its work. If you're not sure how it works, just right click the node, and you can see I prepared a short intro in it.
