## VVVV.KTools
I build this repo to store some of the patches I think useful during my learning and exercising. You can download them and do whatever you like with them.
## How to use them as subpatches?
To use my patches as subpatches, simply clone the one suits your need to your computer, then change the filename from XXX.XML to XXX.V4P. Voila! Now you've got a functional subpatch ready at your service. Drag and drop it to your main patch and let it do its work. If you're not sure how it works, just right click the node, and you can see I prepared a short intro in it.

Note: In order to open the demo_xxx file properly, you need to put both demo file and the corresponding subpatch file under a same directory, or otherwise it will show red in the patch.
## Subpatch Doc
Work in progress :)
